# Homelab setup

## Objectives
- Be able to easily deploy and manage DNS within and outside of homelab
- Set up some sort of automation for adding new dns entries
- Use caddy/tailscale to help manage this

## Setup
The below docs outline my current set up. Within the caddy folders are also caddy specific configs.
